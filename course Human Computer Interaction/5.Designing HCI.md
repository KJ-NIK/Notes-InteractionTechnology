# **Designing HCI**
**Interaction Design**
> Consider who the users are, what activities are being carried out, where interaction is taking place.  
> Involve users in design process

**Interaction design process**  
* Generic steps:
  1. Estabilishing requirements
  2. Designing potential solution (and alternatives)
  3. Prototyping 
  4. Evaluating

**Core characteristics of interaction design**

* users should be involved throughout the process
* function, usability, user experience goals shoule be identified, documented, agreed at the beginning of a project
* iteration is needed

## User-Centered Design
**User-Centered Design Process**
1. Understand context of use (observations, user studies, interviews, questionnaires, literature analysis)
2. Specify user requirements
3. Design solutions
4. Evaluate against requirements (return to 1,2,3)

**Three principles of User-Centered Design**
* early focus on users and tasks
* empirical measurement using quantifiable and measurable usability criteria
* iterative design
  
**Why User-Centered?**
* one size does not fit all
* help understand users requirements
* identify incorrect assumptions designers have about users
* be aware of both people's sensitivities and capabilities

**Accessibility**
* focuses on disabilities  
  * sensory impairements
  * physical impairements
  * cognitive impairements    

**Inclusiveness**
 * accumulate the widest possible number of people (regardless of age, education...) 

**Design Principles**
1. Visibility (keep options visible, in a natural/logical order, no remembering)
2. Feedback (constant feedback, keep users informed)
3. Constraints (prevent errors, warn users)
4. Consistency (maintain consistent standards without learning)
5. Affordance (plain language, troubleshooting source)
