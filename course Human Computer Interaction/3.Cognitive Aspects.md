# **Cognitive Aspects**

**Why understanding cognition?**
* identifies and explains the nature and causes of problems that users encounter
* all cognitive processes are revelant to interaction (*Attention, Perception, Memory, Learning*)
* provides theories, modelling tools, guidance that can lead to better design
  
## **Attention**
> Select things on what to concentrate at a point of time from the mass of stimuli around us  

Degree of easiness/difficulty of paying attention depends on:
* whether someone has <u>clear goals</u>
* whether the information they need is <u>salient</u> in the environment  
(current research (2022) mainly focuses on visual or audio senses, but is increasing in other modalities)

**Design implications**
* consider context, make information **salient** when it requires attention at a given stage of a task
  * For visual interfaces: animated graphics, color, underlying spacing/ordering of items, sequencing of different information
  * Aesthetics: they are good as long as they do not distract users attention away from the core
* avoid cluttering interfaces with too much information
  * too many colors and graphics
  * overuse of modalities
* consider designing different ways of supporting effective switching and returning to a particular interface

## **Perception**
> How information is acquired from the world using the five senses and transformed into experiences  
> *Vision > Hearing > Touch*

**Design implications**
> Representaions of information need to be designed to be readily perceptible and recognizable across different media

* Design icons and other graphical representations that can readily perceivable
* Obvious separators and white space are effective visual method for grouping information that make it easier to perceive and locate items
* Design audio sounds to be readiy distinguishable from one another

## **Memory**
> Memory involves RECALLING various kinds of knowledge that allows people to act appropriately,

* **Encoding & Recalling**
  1. encoding (first step) determines what information to be attended and how it is interpreted
  2. more attention is paid
  3. more it is processed
  4. more likely to be remembered

* **Context & Recalling**  
Context affects the extent to which information can be subsequently retrieved.

* **Recognition & Recalling**   
Recognizing is much easier than being able to recall (compare command-based interface with GUI/Web browser)

* **Multi-modality & Recalling**  
Physicality and haptic influence and improve visually perceived memories.

**Design implications**
<font color=#000080>
*  reduce cognitive </font> load by avoiding long and comlicated procedures for carrying out tasks
*  Design interfaces that:
   <font color=#000080>
   * promote engagement/activity processing (encoding)
   * use proper contextual cues (context)
   * use recognition rather than recalling (recognition)
   * are tangible, immersive and use carefully selected different sensory channels (multi-modality)

## **Learning**
> Learning involves accumulation of skills and knowledge involving memory.  
> *Incidental & Intentional Learning*

<font color=#FF4500>
Active involvement &rarr; doing something &rarr; active exploration promotes learning 
</font>

&nbsp;

**Design implications**  
Design interfaces that:
<font color=#000080>
* encourage exploration and doing
* constrain and guide users to select appropriate actions when initially learning
* dynamically link concepts and representations which can facilitate the learning of complex materials
</font>

&nbsp;

## Cognitive Frameworks
> Conceptual frameworks that explain and predict user behavior based on theories of cognition

**Benefits**
* help understand human behavior, responses, reactions, interactions, decision-making
* helps design better interactions / interfaces
* helps choose appropriate input / output devices or sensors
* help choose between alternaive interaction modalities
