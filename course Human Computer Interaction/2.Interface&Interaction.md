# **Interface and Interaction**
>**Interaction**: communication between the interactive system and the user.

**Challenges**
> Gulf of Execution and Gulf Evaluation (Don Norman)

* Reduce Gulf of Execution: the gap between a user's goal for action and the means to execute the goal
* Reduce Gulf of Evaluation: the degree to which the system or artifacts provides representations that can be directly perceived and interpreted in terms of the expectations and intentions of the user
  
## **Interaction Types**
* **Instructing**: users issue instructions to system and select options
* **Conversing**: interacting with a system as if having a conversation
* **Manipulate**: interacting with objects in a virtual or physical space by manipulating them
* **Exploring**: moving through a virtual environment or a physical space
* **Responding**: the syste initates the interaction and the user chooses whether to respond

**Difference between interaction type and interface style**  
*Interaction type*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A description of what the user is doing when interacting with a system.
&nbsp;

*Interface style*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kind of interface used to support the interaction   
> command-line, graphical user, AR/VR/XR, gestural, voice, touch, tangible, pen-based, multi-modal, brain-computer, wearable, shareable interface
> 
&nbsp;

## **Interaction Model**
> Describes and groups the things that a person can do with a system <u>(perspective of an interacting person)</u>, rather than the result of the action

**Windows, Icons, Menus, and a Pointer**
* Spatial division is <u>simple</u> and either use tiling or overlapping <u>windows</u>
* Items not in current use can be represented by <u>small icons</u>
* <u>Command controls</u> can be replaced by <u>menus</u>
* <u>Pointer</u> interaction allows movement between spatially
* <u>Separate</u> interface items

**Direct manipulation**
> The user directly manipulates an object presented to them using actions that correspond at least loosely to manipulation of physical objects

*Panning and zooming*   
*Dragging and dropping*  
* continuous representation of objects and actions of interests
* physical actions and button pressing instrad of issuing command with complex syntax
* rapid reversible actions with immediate feedback on object of interest

**Natural Interaction**
>Interaction is closer to human actions, what users naturally do to interact, is enabled through sensing and actuations
